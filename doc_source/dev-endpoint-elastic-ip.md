# Accessing Your Development Endpoint<a name="dev-endpoint-elastic-ip"></a>

When you create a development endpoint in a virtual private cloud \(VPC\), AWS Glue returns only a private IP address\. The public IP address field is not populated\. When you create a non\-VPC development endpoint, AWS Glue returns only a public IP address\.

If your development endpoint has a **Public address**, confirm that it is reachable with the SSH private key for the development endpoint, as in the following example\.

```
ssh -i dev-endpoint-private-key.pem glue@public-address
```

Suppose that your development endpoint has a **Private address**, your VPC subnet is routable from the public internet, and its security groups allow inbound access from your client\. In this case, follow these steps to attach an *Elastic IP address* to a development endpoint to allow access from the internet\.

**Note**  
If you want to use Elastic IP addresses, the subnet that is being used requires an internet gateway associated through the route table\.

**To access a development endpoint by attaching an Elastic IP address**

1. Open the AWS Glue console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/glue/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/glue/)\.

1. In the navigation pane, choose **Dev endpoints**, and navigate to the development endpoint details page\. Record the **Private address** for use in the next step\. 

1. Open the Amazon EC2 console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/ec2/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/)\.

1. In the navigation pane, under **Network & Security**, choose **Network Interfaces**\. 

1. Search for the **Private DNS \(IPv4\)** that corresponds to the **Private address** on the AWS Glue console development endpoint details page\. 

   You might need to modify which columns are displayed on your Amazon EC2 console\. Note the **Network interface ID** \(ENI\) for this address \(for example, `eni-12345678`\)\.

1. On the Amazon EC2 console, under **Network & Security**, choose **Elastic IPs**\. 

1. Choose **Allocate new address**, and then choose **Allocate** to allocate a new Elastic IP address\.

1. On the **Elastic IPs** page, choose the newly allocated **Elastic IP**\. Then choose **Actions**, **Associate address**\.

1. On the **Associate address** page, do the following:
   + For **Resource type**, choose **Network interface**\.
   + In the **Network interface** box, enter the **Network interface ID** \(ENI\) for the private address\.
   + Choose **Associate**\.

1. Confirm that the newly associated Elastic IP address is reachable with the SSH private key that is associated with the development endpoint, as in the following example\. 

   ```
   ssh -i dev-endpoint-private-key.pem glue@elastic-ip
   ```
