For more information, see the [AWS Glue pricing page](https://aws.amazon.com/glue/pricing/)\.

  Do not set `Max Capacity` if using `WorkerType` and `NumberOfWorkers`\.

  The value that can be allocated for `MaxCapacity` depends on whether you are running a Python shell job, an Apache Spark ETL job, or an Apache Spark streaming ETL job:

  The type of predefined worker that is allocated when a job runs\. Accepts a value of Standard, G\.1X, or G\.2X\.
  + For the `Standard` worker type, each worker provides 4 vCPU, 16 GB of memory and a 50GB disk, and 2 executors per worker\.
  + For the `G.1X` worker type, each worker maps to 1 DPU \(4 vCPU, 16 GB of memory, 64 GB disk\), and provides 1 executor per worker\. We recommend this worker type for memory\-intensive jobs\.
  + For the `G.2X` worker type, each worker maps to 2 DPU \(8 vCPU, 32 GB of memory, 128 GB disk\), and provides 1 executor per worker\. We recommend this worker type for memory\-intensive jobs\.
+ `NumberOfWorkers` – Number \(integer\)\.
