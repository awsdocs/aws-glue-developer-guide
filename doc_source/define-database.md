# Defining a Database in Your Data Catalog<a name="define-database"></a>

When you define a table in the AWS Glue Data Catalog, you add it to a database\. A database is used to organize tables in AWS Glue\. You can organize your tables using a crawler or using the AWS Glue console\. A table can be in only one database at a time\.

Your database can contain tables that define data from many different data stores\. This data can include objects in Amazon Simple Storage Service \(Amazon S3\) and relational tables in Amazon Relational Database Service\.

**Note**  
When you delete a database, all the tables in the database are also deleted\.

 For more information about defining a database using the AWS Glue console, see [Working with Databases on the AWS Glue Console](console-databases.md)\.
