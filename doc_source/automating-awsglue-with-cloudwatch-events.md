# Automating AWS Glue with CloudWatch Events<a name="automating-awsglue-with-cloudwatch-events"></a>

You can use Amazon CloudWatch Events to automate your AWS services and respond automatically to system events such as application availability issues or resource changes\. Events from AWS services are delivered to CloudWatch Events in near real time\. You can write simple rules to indicate which events are of interest to you, and what automated actions to take when an event matches a rule\. The actions that can be automatically triggered include the following:

+ Invoking an AWS Lambda function

+ Invoking Amazon EC2 Run Command

+ Relaying the event to Amazon Kinesis Data Streams

+ Activating an AWS Step Functions state machine

+ Notifying an Amazon SNS topic or an AWS SMS queue

Some examples of using CloudWatch Events with AWS Glue include the following:

+ Activating a Lambda function when an ETL job succeeds

+ Notifying an Amazon SNS topic when an ETL job fails

The following CloudWatch Events are generated by AWS Glue\.

+ Events for `"detail-type":"Glue Job State Change"` are generated for `SUCCEEDED`, `FAILED`, or `STOPPED`\.

+ Events for `"detail-type":"Glue Crawler State Change"` are generated for `Started`, `Succeeded`, or `Failed`\.
